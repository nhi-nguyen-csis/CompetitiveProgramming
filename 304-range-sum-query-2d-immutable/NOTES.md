### Practice Diary
​
#### Bad:
I made this problem way more complicated than it needed to be. I was looking for optimizations. Instead, I should have just tried the brute force solution right from the get go.
​
#### Bad:
`200 * 200 * 10 ^ 5 => 4 * 10 ^ 9`
I was worried about needing long 64 bit number for keeping the sum, but apparently, I was wrong about that.
