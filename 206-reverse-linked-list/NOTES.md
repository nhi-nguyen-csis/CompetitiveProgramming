### Learning Diary
#### Bad:
This is a tricky one. I've can do the recursive and iterative solutions for now, but I'm not confident I can work out these solutions a week from now (or a month from now).
#### Next:
Work on some excalidraw diagrams. If I focus on the diagrams, that should help me learn these things.
