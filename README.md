# CompetitiveProgramming

Here is my Youtube channel:

Good or bad, I upload all my weekly Leetcode Contests. I do those in Kotlin.

I'm also active on https://binarysearch.com/
That site doesn't support Kotlin, so I use Java for that one. 

If you'd like to see me when I'm on there, so you can challenge me for a friendly contest, you can add me as a friend here:
